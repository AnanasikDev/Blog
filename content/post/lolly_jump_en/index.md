###

As a school project, I developed Lolly Jump, a mobile game on Unity. You can download it or play it in your browser on the [Itch.io](https://ananasikdeveloper.itch.io/lolly-jump) page.

Historically, this is one of my first projects on Unity, started on November 4, 2020. Over the course of several years, I returned to it from time to time and updated it, which you can explore in more detail on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnanasikDev/LollyJump) â€” all the code is open source.
