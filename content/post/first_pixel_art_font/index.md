I have wanted to make my very own font for a very long time, and now I actually did it! Check it out on itch.io! Since I am using it constantly in various software as my main font (in fact this website also uses it, hopefully:>) it received occasional updates with fixes and improvements.

It supports English (Latin), Russian, Ukranian (Cyrillics), German (umlauts), (maybe some other languages). It supports all the necessary characters as well.

To create it I used [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and [Pixel Font exporter](https://yal.cc/tools/pixel-font/).
